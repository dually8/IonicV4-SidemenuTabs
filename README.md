# Mixing Sidemenu and Tabs with Ionic v4 beta

So, I have a bunch of apps at work that use a combo of sidemenu and tabs, so I have been fighting with trying to make them play nicely together with Ionic v4 since I was able to do in v1 and v3.

TLDR How to - Don't use lazy loading and use a single router

Perhaps there is a better way of doing this, but I haven't seen it yet, and I've already had enough anxiety about this already, so, your pull requests/suggestions are very much welcome.

Thanks
